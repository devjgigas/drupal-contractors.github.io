        <p>Protect your personal information by never providing social security, credit card or bank account numbers to prospective employers.</p>

<p>This page states the Terms of Use (“Terms”) under which you (“You”) may use the Drupal Contractors Sites and the Drupal Contractors Services (each as defined below). These Terms include the Drupal Contractors Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms by reference. These Terms constitute a binding agreement between You and Drupal Contractors or the Drupal Contractors company operating the Web site for the country in which You live or in which business is headquartered (“Drupal Contractors”), and are deemed accepted by You each time that You use or access any Drupal Contractors Site or Drupal Contractor Services. If You do not accept the Terms stated here, do not use the Drupal Contractors Sites and the Drupal Contractors Services. Drupal is a trademark of Dries Buytaert and Drupal Contractors has no direct official association with Drupal.org, or Dries Buytaert.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>The Drupal Contractors Sites are defined as any Web sites under Drupal Contractors’ control, whether partial or otherwise (including, without limitation, DrupalContractors.com and the Web site from which these terms of use were accessed from). The Drupal Contractors Sites include a variety of features and services, including an on-line service to post and search employment opportunities (“Drupal Contractors Services”). The Drupal Contractors Sites also include on-line communities designed to facilitate valuable professional and personal networking among users of the Drupal Contractors Sites (“Users”) based on common experiences and interests (“Drupal Contractors Communities”). The Drupal Contractors Sites also allow Users to create individual profiles, which may include personal information (”Profiles”), and to make these Profiles, or aspects thereof, public. Drupal Contractors may revise these Terms at any time by posting an updated version to this Web page. You should visit this page periodically to review the most current Terms because they are binding on You. Users who violate these Terms may have their access and use of the Drupal Contractors Sites suspended or terminated, at Drupal Contractors’ discretion. You must be 13 years of age or older to visit or use any Drupal Contractors Site in any manner, and, if under the age of 18 or the age of majority as that is defined in Your jurisdiction, must use any Drupal Contractors Site under the supervision of a parent, legal guardian, or other responsible adult.</p>

<p>1. Use of Drupal Contractors Content.</p>

<p>Drupal Contractors authorizes You, subject to these Terms, to access and use the Drupal Contractors Sites and the Drupal Contractors Content (as defined below) and to download and print a single copy of the content available on or from the Drupal Contractors Sites solely for Your personal, non-commercial use. The contents of the Drupal Contractors Sites, such as designs, text, graphics, images, video, information, logos, button icons, software, audio files and other Drupal Contractors content (collectively, “Drupal Contractors Content”), are protected under copyright, trademark and other laws. All Drupal Contractors Content is the property of Drupal Contractors or its licensors. The compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement and assembly) of all content on the Drupal Contractors Sites is the exclusive property of Drupal Contractors and is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. Unauthorized use of the Drupal Contractors Content may violate these laws and/or applicable communications regulations and statutes, and is strictly prohibited. You must preserve all copyright, trademark, service mark and other proprietary notices contained in the original Drupal Contractors Content on any authorized copy You make of the Drupal Contractors Content.</p>

<p>Any code that Drupal Contractors creates to generate or display any Drupal Contractors Content or the pages making up any Drupal Contractors Site is also protected by Drupal Contractors’ copyright and You may not copy or adapt such code.</p>

<p>You may not use any of the Drupal Contractors Content on any other Web site or in a networked computer environment (including, without limitation, by uploading or republishing Drupal Contractors Content on any Internet, Intranet or Extranet site or incorporating the Drupal Contractors Content in any other database or compilation for any purpose). Unless explicitly stated herein, nothing in these Terms shall be construed as conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise. This license is revocable at any time without notice and with or without cause.</p>

Your use of the Drupal Contractors Services is also subject to any other contracts You may have with Drupal Contractors. In the case of any conflict between these Terms and any contract you have with Drupal Contractors, the terms of your contract will prevail. The term “post” as used herein shall mean information that You submit, publish or display on a Drupal Contractors Site.</p>

<p>All Drupal Contractors Users agree to not:</p>
