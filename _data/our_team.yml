      Our story begins with two software developers who met at their day jobs and discovered they had quite a bit in common.

      Chris McGrath and Albert Volkman founded WP Contractors to address their shared interest. Together with a team of ambitious go-getters, they built one of the world's largest WordPress talent networks

      WP Contractors exists to solve the very issue AI and Chris noticed while working at a Seattle-based digital agency. Employers in the digital space struggled to hire WordPress talent.

      There simply weren't enough developers to fill open roles, and anyone good was already busy.

      The solution? A platform where advice support, tools, and people can come together.

      Our vision is built upon the idea that relationships matter. People matter. Networks matter.

      We strive to lower your hiring risk by building a vast network of high-quality, pre-screened digital WordPress professionals available for whatever work you current team can't handle.
